add dependencies
flutter pub add --dev json_serializable build_runner
1. json_serializable

json_annotation is a regular dependency because its annotations are used in your actual application code.
json_serializable and build_runner are development dependencies (--dev flag) because they are only used during the
 development phase to generate the serialization code and are not included in the final app's source code.
2. response structure
{
  "users": [ ... ],
  "total": 100,
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 30
}
3. build_runner
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
